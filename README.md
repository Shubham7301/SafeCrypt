"Crypto Guard" project, an application designed to offer encryption and decryption services using multiple 
cryptographic algorithms. 
 
The project involved the development of a Streamlit-based app that supports AES, DES, 3DES, and RSA 
encryption and decryption, along with MD5 and SHA-256 hashing. The app also includes a Caesar Cipher. 
Each algorithm was implemented with a focus on security, efficiency, and user-friendliness.
